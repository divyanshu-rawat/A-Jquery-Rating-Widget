### Live Application

[![Live Demo Here](https://img.shields.io/badge/website-up-orange.svg)](http://myratingwidget.bitballoon.com/)

##

### Description 

* App provides five circles for the user to select or click on.
  When the user hovers their mouse over a circle, that circle and all circles to the left must be filled with a color, such     as yellow.
  
* Provide a configurable number of circles for the user to click on.Allow the number of circles to be updated by a text-box.
  This is to simulate an administration widget.
  I have not added any form of security to the widget.
  
* Final feature to my rating widget,the ability to send the rating to a service.
  The service has already been created. The service will act as a simple echo service,
  taking the rating you submit inside a JSON object, and then sending back a JSON containing a message
